## Getting Started

  This is my first Capstone project at Microverse. It is my pleasure to thank the contributors on the website www.behance.net. This project is addressed to build using multiple HTML and CSS properties, including flexbox, grids and many more.  

  The reason behind this project is to use my whole experience and knowledge I got for a month and it is only for educational purposes. Anyone who thinks about using it for their own learning is welcomed. I appreciate everyone who is interested in this project.

  As a microverse student, while implementing this project, I once again refreshed my knowledge of HTML and CSS. Below, you are given instructions how to use them on your own machines.

**This is how you may setup this project locally.**
